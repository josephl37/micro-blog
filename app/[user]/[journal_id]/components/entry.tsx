          Fixed some bugs today ranging from design to edge cases like not
          having a pfp or twitter. Overall pretty happy with what weâ€™re able to
          build. Think the biggest learnings was collaborating on git. Working
          off a new branch, making a PR and avoiding merge conflicts was
          definitely a process.
